    <title>At ₹558 crore, highest-ever seizures made in Karnataka </title>
    <p>


        The Election Commission seized a whopping ₹557.69 crore from March 16, when the model code of conduct (MCC) for
        the Lok Sabha election came into force, until the end of the final phase of polling on May 7 in the State. This
        is the highest-ever pre-poll seizure in Karnataka. During the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, ₹88.27 crore was seized,
        according to Election Commission <data value="" class="sbr"></data> <br>


        This is apart from the seizure of goods worth ₹348.71 crore by the Commercial Taxes Department. These goods
        include iron ore and ghutka, the proceeds of which would have been used for inducements. Besides, from August
        last year to March 16, poll personnel seized cash and goods worth ₹537 crore in Karnataka. The seizures include
        ₹151 crore in cash, liquor worth ₹42 crore, drugs worth ₹126 crore, gold worth ₹71 crore, and other items valued
        at ₹144 crore.
